Coding Class in Altos de Chavon School of Design

This repository was created as a learning tool. 
As I am currently learning how to code and program web pages, I upload different projects given to us to practice and learn about the subject.
From a simple WebBio to developing a web page for an Eraser, I trust Github to be a showroom to my developing programmer abilities.
