	<h1> Rossana Ruggeri </h1>
	<h2> Biography </h2>

	<p> Born in Venezuela,  in 1990. I started my studies in Graphic Design at the Nueva Esparta University in Venezuela, where I lasted one and a half year before the sociopolitical problems in my country forced me to go abroad. I arrived to Italy and began studying Industrial and Nautical Design at Genoa’s University. During this period I worked as an intern in the graphic design agency PBCom Brand Engine, one of the most influential studios in Genoa. Looking forward to continue my passion in graphic design, I transferred to Altos de Chavón School of Design in the Dominican Republic, where I’m presently studying and looking forward to grow as a professional designer. </p>
